# Dice-Rolling-Simulator-Python-
A simple Python dice-rolling simulator that uses the random module to generate a number between 1 and 6. Users can roll multiple times, and each roll displays a new random result. This project demonstrates basic Python concepts like loops, user input, and random number generation.
